I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Sciences Po ([Centre for Research on Social Inequalities](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en.html)) and [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/), under the supervision of [Lucas Chancel](https://lucaschancel.com/) (PSE & Sciences Po) and [Harold Levrel](https://www.centre-cired.fr/harold-levrel/) (AgroParisTech & CIRED). My research is funded by the French Ministry for Ecological Transition, where I work in an operational department in charge of land use planning and biodiversity conservation policies.

My work involves studying the equity issues in policies preventing land take in France, within the global context of addressing land degradation and biodiversity loss. My research interests lie at the intersection between environmental justice, land economics and biodiversity conservation. Find out more about my ongoing research projects here. 

I hold a master's degree in engineering from [Mines Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/en/home/) and a master's degree in economics from the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ppd-public-policy-and-development/) and previously worked at the World Bank, the think tank La Fabrique de l'industrie, and the environmental consultancy I Care & Consult.
