I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Sciences Po ([Centre for Research on Social Inequalities](https://www.sciencespo.fr/osc/en.html) & [Department of Economics](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/)) and [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/), under the supervision of [Lucas Chancel](https://lucaschancel.com/) (PSE & Sciences Po) and [Harold Levrel](https://cesco.mnhn.fr/fr/annuaire/harold-levrel-6495) (MNHN & CIRED). My research is funded by the French Ministry for Ecological Transition, where I work in an operational department in charge of land use planning and biodiversity conservation policies. I have also received a grant from the Fondation Palladio to support my work.

During Winter 2025, I was visiting the [Department of Geography and Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment) at the London School of Economics. 

My work involves studying the equity issues in policies preventing land take in France, within the global context of addressing land degradation and biodiversity loss. My research interests lie at the intersection between environmental inequalities, urban economics and biodiversity conservation. Find out more about my ongoing research projects [here](https://eulaliesaisset.github.io/research/).

I hold a master's degree in engineering from [Mines Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/en/home/) and a master's degree in economics from the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ppd-public-policy-and-development/) and previously worked at the World Bank and the environmental consultancy I Care & Consult.

**P.S.** If you’re wondering how to pronounce my name, you’re not alone.  I don’t mind if it gets a little mangled or shortened to “Laly.”  But if you’d like the full version, try this: **uh-lah-lee**.
**uh**, like in *urban* or *earth*; **lah**, like in *lark* or *latitude*; **lee**, like in *leaf* or *valley*.
